				Marvel movies can be compared with the cinema of attraction 
				that was prominent during the beginning of the 20th century. 
				This type of cinema strived to captivate audiences in fictional 
				worlds and entice them with visual effects and fantastical 
				storylines. Much like this type of cinema, the artistic value 
				of Marvel movies lies with their ability to create powerful 
				emotions for their audiences, to amaze them with their visual 
				effects and to resonate with them on a deep personal level.
